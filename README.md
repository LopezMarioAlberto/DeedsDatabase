# DeedsDatabase

Project: Deeds Database.

Scope: Create a website with a database that facilitates the monitoring of purchases, sales and mortgages operations for Real Estate operations in Spain.

The process starts with the notarial signature, follow by tax payment, cadastral registration and end with the delivery of the dossier to the client.

10 tables will be created (deed, branch, tax-office, notary, registry, client, type, bank, email, city) with 13 many-to-one fields and 1 many-to-many field.

The platform will have access for registered customers with social login, who can make comments and request clarifications throughout the process.
